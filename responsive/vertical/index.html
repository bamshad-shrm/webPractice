			<p>Hello</p>
			<p>Bamshad Shirmohamadi!</p>
			<p>Here I want to introduce myself :)</p>
			<p>I am a telecommunication engineer and I divide my skills in  three major fields of networking, application development and web development. As sequence of my professional experiences, I gained knowledge in a wide verity of aspects in the world of IT. For example, I can build an application for windows or work as a network traffic analyzer.</p>
			<p>I have got my master degree in the field of Electrical engineering with emphasis on Telecommunication systems from Blekinge Institute of Technology in Sweden at 2015. My master thesis was about linking QoE to QoS in networking perspective which is resulted to an IEEE publication.</p>
			<p>If you want to know more about me, pleas click on the icons in the right side.</p>
			<p>From 2018/09 I decided to make some sample programs and videos about my skills. By doing so, firstly I share my knowledge with others and secondly YOU can inform me if there is something wrong :)</p>
			<p>So, I would be happy if you take a look on them and let me know about your ideas.</p>
